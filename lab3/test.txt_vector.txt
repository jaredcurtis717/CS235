Sports
for
Everyone
I
push
the
sights
of
my
gun
slowly
to
the
right
lining
up
the
reticule
perfectly
with
my
target
I
take
a
deep
breath
and
pull
the
trigger
A
sense
of
euphoria
fills
me
as
I
see
the
beautifully
gory
pop
of
a
zombies
head
exploding
on
my
screen
Video
games
are
an
amazing
way
to
escape
reality
if
only
for
a
moment
Playing
video
games
is
the
only
form
of
interactive
media
entertainment
How
one
interacts
with
a
game
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
video
game
creator
and
the
user
Some
games
are
meant
to
be
experienced
as
a
work
of
art
others
are
made
to
roleplay
another
life
and
still
others
are
made
to
please
a
barbaric
trait
of
evolution
Competition
An
Esport
or
Electronicsport
is
defined
as
A
multiplayer
video
game
played
for
spectators
typically
by
professional
gamers
The
world
of
Esports
has
grown
to
become
a
billiondollar
industry
Even
back
in
million
viewers
tuned
in
to
the
League
of
Legends
World
Final
with
tens
of
thousands
buying
tickets
to
watch
live
The
event
sold
out
and
filled
a
giant
soccer
stadium
built
to
house
the
Fifa
World
Cup
Why
do
so
many
people
watch
other
people
playing
video
games
I
would
respond
in
the
same
way
if
you
asked
me
why
so
many
people
watch
physical
sports
because
playing
these
sports
is
hard
These
different
kinds
of
athletes
spend
hours
and
hours
perfecting
their
craft
They
work
as
hard
or
harder
than
physical
athletes
do
to
be
good
at
their
sport
Professional
players
of
the
game
Starcraft
often
average
over
actions
per
minute
Thats
averaging
completely
different
actions
every
second
Another
statistic
measured
in
Starcraft
is
screens
per
minute
or
the
number
of
different
parts
of
the
playing
area
that
are
flipped
to
every
minute
on
your
screen
Professional
players
often
have
a
statistic
of
screens
per
minute
or
higher
This
means
that
a
player
is
seeing
and
interpreting
completely
new
information
on
average
every
two
seconds
As
you
can
imagine
this
is
extremely
exhausting
for
the
players
and
requires
years
of
practice
to
play
at
that
speed
While
players
of
physical
sports
are
revered
as
heroes
in
communities
everywhere
the
general
population
sees
players
of
Esports
as
nerdy
awkward
kids
wasting
their
lives
away
playing
silly
games
I
think
its
difficult
to
compare
sports
and
Esports
because
of
the
completely
different
skill
sets
required
to
compete
While
both
obviously
require
good
handeye
coordination
and
a
sharp
mind
you
dont
need
to
be
able
to
bench
pounds
to
play
Esports
Likewise
you
wouldnt
need
the
ability
to
calculate
probabilities
of
possible
outcomes
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
to
play
a
sport
like
soccer
where
the
same
skill
could
be
crucial
in
a
game
of
Starcraft
Just
because
these
sports
require
a
different
skill
doesnt
mean
we
should
look
down
on
them
Stereotyping
these
athletes
as
nerdy
awkward
kids
is
hard
on
them
as
people
and
severely
downplays
the
hard
work
that
these
individuals
have
put
in
to
enhance
their
skills
and
play
at
as
high
a
level
as
they
can
I
think
we
can
safely
say
that
generally
sports
require
more
speed
strength
and
endurance
and
Esports
require
more
intelligence
reasoning
and
speedy
decisionmaking
The
NCAA
National
Collegiate
Athletic
Association
states
their
core
purpose
as
Our
purpose
is
to
govern
competition
in
a
fair
safe
equitable
and
sportsmanlike
manner
and
to
integrate
intercollegiate
athletics
into
higher
education
so
that
the
educational
experience
of
the
studentathlete
is
paramount
What
a
great
goal
for
a
national
entity
It
is
easy
for
people
to
see
that
sports
such
as
football
and
soccer
can
have
a
large
impact
in
the
lives
of
the
players
We
and
the
NCAA
believe
that
playing
sports
in
college
can
help
the
studentathlete
mature
and
grow
and
add
positively
to
their
college
experience
If
we
can
build
a
better
educational
experience
for
college
students
by
coaching
and
teaching
them
to
become
faster
and
stronger
through
sports
could
we
not
also
build
a
better
educational
experience
for
college
students
by
coaching
and
teaching
them
to
become
smarter
and
mentally
quicker
through
Esports
Colleges
should
start
varsity
Esport
programs
BYU
would
be
a
perfect
candidate
for
this
type
of
program
Collegiate
Esports
programs
are
nothing
new
The
University
of
Utah
has
recently
opened
their
own
program
of
varsity
Esports
recruiting
players
in
four
different
games
In
fact
hundreds
of
players
from
all
around
the
country
tried
out
for
this
years
limited
varsity
spots
The
University
of
Utah
has
successfully
involved
so
many
more
students
who
might
not
normally
be
very
involved
in
school
activities
BYU
has
an
opportunity
to
be
pioneers
in
the
world
of
Esports
by
following
the
example
of
the
U
and
starting
their
own
program
Varsity
Esports
is
a
cheap
way
to
involve
more
students
and
provide
more
campus
activities
for
the
student
body
to
enjoy
Getting
started
in
an
Esports
program
would
be
relatively
much
cheaper
than
some
other
common
programs
It
can
be
started
with
just
a
few
computers
and
what
college
campus
doesnt
have
a
few
nice
computers
available
and
a
coach
That
is
very
far
off
from
the
cost
of
a
program
like
football
where
it
is
completely
normal
to
spend
ten
million
dollars
annually
Granted
they
make
a
lot
of
money
through
ticket
sales
and
merchandise
sales
but
whos
to
say
that
Esports
wont
be
the
same
way
within
a
few
years
Remember
how
Esports
have
become
a
billion
dollar
industry
That
annual
revenue
has
been
increasing
consistently
by
while
even
the
biggest
soccer
leagues
around
the
globe
average
only
annual
revenue
increase
While
I
was
doing
some
personal
research
on
the
subject
of
Esports
I
came
across
an
article
about
the
possibility
of
Esports
being
added
to
the
Olympic
Games
in
Paris
It
was
an
interesting
read
but
then
I
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
read
some
of
the
comments
Comments
included
how
big
of
a
shame
this
article
was
how
idiotic
the
idea
was
and
even
one
user
asking
if
this
was
some
sort
of
April
fools
joke
I
can
assure
you
Esports
are
no
joke
People
take
their
competition
very
seriously
and
the
world
is
just
starting
to
see
how
exciting
and
interesting
these
competitions
really
are
Those
who
cannot
see
the
growth
challenge
and
excitement
of
Esports
or
who
are
just
flat
out
against
the
idea
will
be
left
behind
by
the
millions
enjoying
the
new
trend
We
are
far
from
the
days
when
video
games
were
seen
only
to
rot
the
brains
of
their
users
Esports
can
be
used
to
encourage
new
types
of
athletes
to
step
out
of
the
shadows
and
show
off
their
abilities
Esports
programs
are
relatively
low
cost
compared
to
other
campus
organizations
and
have
the
potential
to
do
so
much
good
for
the
student
body
and
the
college
itself
And
hey
maybe
if
we
cant
beat
the
U
in
football
well
have
the
edge
in
a
more
brains
over
bran
competition
